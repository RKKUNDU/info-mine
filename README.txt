Motivation:
Many of the courses tend to prefer certain platforms over the others for providing updates, quiz info, discussions etc.
Also, apart from the courses, we have two emails, which are insti and department.
This causes a student to visit multiple sites many times which can get discomforting after a certain point, and students can also miss out on some updates.
Thus, the aim of this project is to reduce the hindrance in visting many places and create a tool that helps students to get all their info in one spot. 
The term Info-Mine comes from mining for information from cse websites, moodle and the emails.
